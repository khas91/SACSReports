/*
	Author: Stuart Pierson
	ORION Program: STDL01J3 Program Approval Report.
	
	Report produces a file with the following heading:

	Pgm Cd, Offcl TTL, Cip Cd, Awd Ty, Crd Hrs, Cntct Hrs, F/A Appr, SACS Appr, Eff Trm, End Trm,   

	One issue I'm noticing is that the sample report that I was given by Karen Stearns AA, AS, and AAS programs in it, but no others.
	I don't know how to get the ORION program to give those results. This data might have been messed with to isolate those results. I'll
	have to ask her.
